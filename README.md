# 🏺 The Amazing Indo-Afrikaan's Rug Machine

> **"Where villages are fed"** 🌾

---

## 🎭 The Legend

In the dusty crossroads between Indonesia and South Africa, a mystical weaver discovered the ancient art of **philanthropic rug-pulling**. Unlike ordinary rugs that disappear into the night, these rugs feed entire villages while simultaneously generating astronomical returns for early believers.

This is not financial advice. This is **folklore**.

## 🪙 $RUGS Token

**Network:** Solana  
**Total Supply:** TBD (To Be Determined by the village elders)  
**Utility:** Feeding villages, one rug at a time

### Tokenomics

- **50%** - Community Airdrop (Villages must eat)
- **30%** - Liquidity Pool (The weaving fund)
- **15%** - Development (Rug maintenance)
- **5%** - Marketing (Spreading the legend)

> *Note: These percentages are subject to change based on village hunger levels*

## 🎨 The Vision

Every transaction on the Indo-Afrikaan Rug Machine contributes to:
1. **Village Feeding Programs** (hypothetically)
2. **Rug Weaving Education** (metaphorically)
3. **Cultural Exchange** (symbolically)
4. **Meme Proliferation** (actually)
